# Lung-absorption-model
Pulmonary drug absorption implemented in MoBi (Eriksson et al. 2020)

The presented model has been used for predictions of systemic exposure after drug administration via the lungs.   

The predictive performances of the model were evaluated by comparing simulated plasma concentration-time profiles to clinical observations after pulmonary administration of drug in solution, as supension or as dry powder.
